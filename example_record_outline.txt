How to structure a scan collection:
Example: RBML, artefacts
   [Organization] RBML
    [Collection] General Realia, Costume, Winston Churchill
        - descriptive metadata for collection level
        - [Item] Hairpiece 
           - Lieber 7 Props, Costume Pieces Box 37, OVERSIZE
           - Props, Costume pieces Box 38
           - application provenance metadata (aggregated from changes to specific slices/scopes/files)
               - [Entity] Haripiece 1
               - descriptive metadata for specific slice
                    - [File] files have workflow-scope (which folder is it in): 
                        - [Scope - 3deposit-specific designation] Scope
                            [ie. "Pre-process", "Post-process", "Export"]
                        - pre-process raw files
                            - who was the scanner?
                            - 3deposit-specific metadata
                        - post-process files 
                        - export models 
                        - extracted/generated technical metadata
